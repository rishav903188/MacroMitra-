# MacroMitra 💪

MacroMitra is a priority-based Indian macro calculator built with React and Tailwind CSS.

It helps users determine how much quantity of locally available foods (like rice, chicken, roti, dal, paneer, etc.) they should consume in order to hit their target protein, carbohydrate, fat, and calorie goals.

## 🔥 Core Idea

Instead of forcing perfect macro matching, MacroMitra follows a priority-based macro engine:

1. Protein (Highest Priority)
2. Calories
3. Carbohydrates
4. Fat

The system selects the most efficient macro sources from selected foods and calculates optimized quantities.
